# MTA Daily Subway Ridership Estimator
I. Abstract
The Mass transit Authority of New York City has been sharing its ridership and traffic data online each day during the coronavirus pandemic. Available to download is all the data for all of the agency's transport services. About the subway data: Subway ridership figures are determined from MetroCard and OMNY swipes and taps, and include ridership on the Staten Island Railway. Figures from recent days may be revised as data reconciliation processes are carried out. This project aims to implement the available data provided by the MTA and other data resources to train a artificial neural network to predict the MTA's dailiy subway ridership.
