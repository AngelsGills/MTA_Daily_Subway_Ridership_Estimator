# MTA Daily Subway Ridership Estimator
I. Abstract

The Mass transit Authority of New York City has been sharing its ridership and traffic data online each day during the coronavirus pandemic. Available to download is all the data for all of the agency's transport services. About the subway data: Subway ridership figures are determined from MetroCard and OMNY swipes and taps, and include ridership on the Staten Island Railway. Figures from recent days may be revised as data reconciliation processes are carried out. This project aims to implement the available data provided by the MTA and other data resources to train a artificial neural network to predict the MTA's dailiy subway ridership.

II. Introduction

The MTA has been sharing the ridership and traffic data each day to help you understand how many people are using our services in and around New York City. All of the agency's services are updated to provide an estimated ridership number for each specific date. The data provided for all transit services is compared to a percent of a comparable pre-pandemic day.
